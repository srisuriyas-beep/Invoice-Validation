Invoice PDF Validator is a Java-based Selenium automation framework designed to streamline invoice verification for billing or e-commerce applications. 
It automates user login using data-driven credentials, downloads invoice PDFs, and extracts key details like invoice number, customer info, item list, and total amount using Apache PDFBox. 
These details are validated against expected data stored in Excel files via Apache POI. 
The framework supports parallel browser execution, QR code validation, and generates detailed reports using ExtentReports or Allure. 
It also includes features like screenshot capture on failure, email report delivery, and Jenkins integration for CI/CD workflows.
